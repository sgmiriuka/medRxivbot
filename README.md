# **medRxivbot**

A twitter bot from [@MiriukaLab](https://twitter.com/MiriukaLab) for filtering just published  [@medrxivpreprint](https://twitter.com/medrxivpreprint) papers according to keywords. The first clon can be followed at [@rxivbot](https://twitter.com/rxivbot). 

This is a clone of [@BiorxivB](https://twitter.com/BiorxivB)

**Purpose:** A bot that checks bioRxiv papers published the day before and tweets them if provided keywords are found in the abstract. Ideally, you should set crontab in a server for a scheduled activation and tweeting. Alternatively, just run it everyday :(

## Installation


```bash
git clone https://github.com/sgmiriuka/medRxivbot.git
```

### Dependencies

* python=3.7
* Tweepy=3.9.0
* requests=2.25.0
* beautifulsoup4=4.9.3
* lxml=4.6.2

Not checked with different versions. 

## Set up

1. Create a twitter account. 
2. Apply for a [developers twitter account](https://developer.twitter.com/en)
3. Get the four long complex weird keys and add them to a file called **credential.txt** file. One line per key, such as in fake_credential_file.txt.

4. Your bot will tweet what you are interested in. So, write down your keywords in the **search.txt** file. For example, you can write __*(pluripotent stem cell OR embryonic stem cell) AND (microRNA OR miRNA)*__. Boolean operators supported are AND, OR, and NOT. Note that the search is case-insensitive. Do not use any quotation marks. Use parenthesis for term aggregation. 
5. You should use [crontab](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/crontab.5.html) to activate it, i.e., every morning, and check any new interesting paper posted in bioRxiv with breakfast. The tweet includes the found keywords and the link to the paper.
